**I am always looking for strong, self-motivated students. ** If you are interested, please reach out. 

My research interests lie in the areas of Multimodal Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction.
My lab primarily focuses on advancing methods in understanding the language, visual, and audio modalities, although we are also broadly interested in the use of physiological sensors. The goal of this is to develop intelligent automation methods that can support various human tasks, which makes up the HCI component. We are interested in all applications where the human is a critical component of use case. Some example applications include the building of intelligent agents that can augment human intelligence, developing AI tutoring methods, supporting decision making in health care, and so on. 

I run the [Assistive Intelligence Lab](/lab). We are always welcoming of students! You can find more information on the [prospective students](/students) page.
